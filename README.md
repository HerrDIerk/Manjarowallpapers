# Linux wallpapers

--Artwork Linux--

All kinds of wallpapers, mostly Linux Manjaro-related. 

You can copy them as much as you like. I only do this because I love it. Some of them are good, others terrible. You may decide... but I won't stop ;-)

*edit It is possible that some older filenames are incorrect. For example : there is a wallpaper called xxxxxTUX, but there is no Tux or whatever on that wallpaper. That's because when I'm started the wallpaper I had something with Tux inmind, but it turned out very different, haha. Sorry for that.
